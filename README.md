## Refactoring Horiseons Website For a Better User Experience

Horiseons website was having difficulty meeting accessibility standards, expressing certain actions, and identifying the core issues that could affect their SEO.

To assist Horiseon we ensured their website links were functional, added alt messaging to ensure accessibility, and touched up their semantic HTML.

As their company grows, so will their website. In the future we hope to add multiple pages to their webpage, including a form for customers to fill out, as well as a page further detailing the services they off, and service packages. 

An About page discussing where the company began, and where they plan to go, would also be an optimal addition. 

Screeshot of current website:
